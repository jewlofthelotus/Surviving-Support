I don't know about you, but vanilla CSS always leaves me wanting more.  It's a fairly simple language, can do some pretty powerful things, but after a while.. well, it can become rather tedious to work with.  Enter Sass: Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets.  Sass is a CSS meta-language and precompiler that makes the prettification of your website a breeze by adding invaluable features of more traditional programming languages.  In this workshop, we'll jump right in to the Sass workflow and cover all the key game changers - nesting, variables, mixins, inheritance, and directives.  We'll also cover some of the gotchyas, tools and extensions, and tips on organization and coding standards.
